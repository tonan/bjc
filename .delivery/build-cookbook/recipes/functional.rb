# How does this work?  The bjc_compliance default recipe contains a resource
# to clone the BJC git repo (so we can get all the inspec profiles).  Once
# all the inspec profiles for the BJC components are on the compliance 
# server, we can run remote scans against a stack by ssh-ing into the 
# compliance box and kicking off `inspec exec` commands.  The wrapper script
# shown below contains the commands to run inspec against our machines.


# Run inspec tests on the machines in our environment
